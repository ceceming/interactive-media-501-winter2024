    <p class="text-discussion">My website is a doll's house, waiting to be decorated. Remember doll's houses? They are mostly like actual houses but sliced from the middle. We can zoom-in to each room, but we can also see the whole house. We see what every doll is doing, and move them around. A website is where we are giants looking over little people, there is an ecosystem in it. We are outside the ecosystem and interacting with whats in it freely. We are the host of this game, the one who decides what is put where. And we get to watch our art piece at the end. A website is an independent being from its creator, but at the same time its created by its creator- so it can't be that independent. If someone else sees the doll's house, they might not immediately recognize it to be yours. There are building blocks after all. Its the little details.</p>
