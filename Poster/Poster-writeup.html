    <h3>Poster: Web as an Infinite Bulletin Board</h3>
    <p>A bulletin board is a public platform. Anyone can stick anything on it, and make the community around the bulletin board be notified. Starbucks is the only place I see bulletin boards today, aside from schools and government buildings. Bulletin board is a culture. One that reminds me on the 90s, the 90s that I never got a chance to experience.</p>
    <p>to be continued... work in progress!</p>
