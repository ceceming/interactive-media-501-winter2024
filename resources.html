    <h4>Interactive Media:Web 501<br>OCAD Winter 2024</h4>
    <h3>Interactive Media: Web Archive</h3>
    <a href="https://www.interactivemediaweb.net/">Course Website</a>
    <p>This is a website made by our course instructor Peter Ha. The site features all the projects, exercises and readings that were given to us in the span of a semester. There is also an archive of past students' works, which function as a resource for inspiration / help.</p>
    <h3>ChatGPT</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT has been a great tool to detect bugs. I have directly inputted code snippets and asked what's wrong, or better ways to write a code. The AI has given corrected code and explained whats wrong in good detail.</p>
    <h3>Codecademy</h3>
    <p>Codcademy has a pretty detailed database and a fairly easy mavigation timestamps to locate where the answer I am looking for is. This is why it was a handy resource, especially early in the course.</p>
    <h3>Pinterest</h3>
    <a href="https://tr.pinterest.com/thececem/">My pinterest archive!</a>
    <p>For visual design, I regularly checked my pinterest archive for any references. I have collected many visuals, belonging to many different sub-genres over the years. I find it easy to apply references from other disciplines to any visual design. I can always look up color palattes, shapes and textures to adapt and transform into different forms.</p>
