            <h3>Part 1: First Approach</h3>
            <p>-time ile ilgili interaction bulmak zordu text input-</p>
            <p>My approach will be calculating the time passed = a change in the site page. either a content spawning, a content generating (so adding on top of whats existing) or changing. My first attempt was to use the Giphy Api to spawn different gifs.
                My second approach I used Timezone API to display the Toronto time and perhaps make a page that will react to timezone. However, this would significantly limit the interaction because the content displayed on the page would change very slowly. So I decided to go with calculating the time spent within each session. Not only this gave me the power to establish a new approach to how to calculate time, and establish its own pace within the page's restrictions; it would also giv em the power to determine how dynamic this abstract piece will be.</p>
            <p>The first sketch I made was a basic code which would randomize the background color every 5 second. This sketch aims to divide the total session to 5 seconds slices. However this doesn't record the amount of time passed. Which is an essential element to craft this as a true "time" triggered piece. The viewer must know how much time has passed. This is still a relevant exercise to understand how the code worked.</p>
