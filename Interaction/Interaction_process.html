            <h3>Part 1: First Approach</h3>
            <p>When I first started thinking about the interaction that I was assigned -duration (time)- I was suprised. I realised that I have associated interaction with mouse actions. However, this interaction required the user to be in a observer state. Which is also an interaction because the user is then informed about the duration that is passed through the interaction of the content. There has to be a content that is interacting with the time passing.</p>
            <p>My approach will be calculating the time passed = a change in the site page. either a content spawning, a content generating (so adding on top of whats existing) or changing. My first attempt was to use the Giphy Api to spawn different gifs.
                My second approach I used Timezone API to display the Toronto time and perhaps make a page that will react to timezone. However, this would significantly limit the interaction because the content displayed on the page would change very slowly. So I decided to go with calculating the time spent within each session. Not only this gave me the power to establish a new approach to how to calculate time, and establish its own pace within the page's restrictions; it would also giv em the power to determine how dynamic this abstract piece will be.</p>
            <p>The first sketch I made was a basic code which would randomize the background color every 5 second. This sketch aims to divide the total session to 5 seconds slices. However this doesn't record the amount of time passed. Which is an essential element to craft this as a true "time" triggered piece. The viewer must know how much time has passed. This is still a relevant exercise to understand how the code worked.</p>

            <h3>Part 2: How do we measure time?</h3>
            <p>In the digital world, there are plenty of ways to experience time passing. Mostly it has something to do with downloading of content before we interact with something. Sometimes this is named as "wait loader" and is designed by UI designers along with other UI assets. These designs add onto our experience of apps/websites. Sometimes this duration is made functional by putting text/visuals there. Most of the times, the user is alone with a gif, resembling time passing as content is downloading.</p>
            <img src="loading.png">
            <p>Another visual way to "see" time passing is the physical object of a hourglass/sand watch. Just like waiting loaders in the digital world, or just like how our batteries on our Iphones load up, the metaphor of hourglass is very tempting to play around with. Pixels, in this sense could be the metaphoric sand particles. Rperesentation of passing time will be my concept for this project.</p>
