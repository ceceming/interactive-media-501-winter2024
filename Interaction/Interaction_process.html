            <h3>Part 1: First Approach</h3>
            <p>-time ile ilgili interaction bulmak zordu text input-</p>
            <p>My approach will be calculating the time passed = a change in the site page. either a content spawning, a content generating (so adding on top of whats existing) or changing. My first attempt was to use the Giphy Api to spawn different gifs.
                My second approach I used Timezone API to display the Toronto time and perhaps make a page that will react to timezone. However, this would significantly limit the interaction becasue the displayed content would change very very slowly. So I decided to go with calculating the time spent with each session.
