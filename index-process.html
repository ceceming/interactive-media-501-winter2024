        <h3>Part 1: Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>I have been spending a lot of time making things with my hands as a form of relatation for the past year. I have learned how to crochet and knit, and tried out making garnments from start to finish for the first time. For my "handmade" index page, I wanted to develop something that was inspired by such shapes, a primitive way of making color palettes and representations. Thus, my aim was to develop a graphic langauge based off on that simple look.</p>

        <p>Pixel art is perhaps the immidiate thing that comes to mind when looked at such constructions of fabric. In fact, this is how you form a shape in cross-stitch too. You treat each loop as a pixel.</p>
        <img src="brain2.jpeg">
        <p>However, I wanted to make things a bit more interesting and complex. And I wanted the interaction to revolve around the shape, so there had to be a transition between the shapes.</p>
        <img src="brain3.jpeg">
        <p>I arrived at 'tiles', as an inspiration to develop some buttons and logos for the index. Because tiles were too constructs of limited shapes, but they had more details inside that suggest representations and a visual language.</p>
        <img src="brain4.jpeg">
        <p>I was thinking perhaps transitioning from such a cultural object to a button or a logo, would make it as playful as I wanted it to be. With the same construction principles in mind, I designed tiles of my own.</p>

        <p>After this initial part of arriving at tiles and the square as a mode of construction, I was now thinking of making it 3D and transforming the 'space' which is the index a 3D environment.</p>
